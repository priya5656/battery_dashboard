🔧 Configuration
Cell Types
The dashboard supports multiple battery chemistries:

LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate)

Nominal Voltage: 3.2V
Operating Range: 2.8V - 3.6V
High cycle life, excellent safety


NMC (Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt)

Nominal Voltage: 3.6V
Operating Range: 3.2V - 4.0V
High energy density


LTO (Lithium Titanate)

Nominal Voltage: 2.4V
Operating Range: 1.5V - 2.8V
Ultra-fast charging, long life



Alert Thresholds
Customize alert thresholds in config.py:
pythonALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
    "temperature": {
        "warning": 40,   # °C
        "critical": 45   # °C
    },
    "voltage": {
        "warning_low_percent": 10,   # % below min
        "critical_low_percent": 20   # % below min
    },
    "health": {
        "warning": 70,   # %
        "critical": 50   # %
    }
}
